Problem Statement

1. What should be the output of the following script?
V <- c (2, 5.5, 6)
t <- c (8, 3, 4)
print(v%/%t)
Answer- 0 1 1

2. You have 25 excel files with names as xx_1.xlsx, xx_2.xlsx…… xx_25.xlsx in a dir.
Write a program to extract the contents of each excel sheet and make it one df.
Answer-
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

file.list <- list.files(pattern='*.xlsx')  
# data frame by column with column id
df.list <- lapply(file.list, read_excel)
df1 <- rbindlist(df.list, idcol = "id")
View(df1)

# data frame by column and if we want file name as column id 
df.list <- sapply(file.list, read_excel, simplify = FALSE)
df2 <- rbindlist(df.list, idcol = "id")
View(df2)

# data frame by row with file names
df3 <- rbind.data.frame(df.list , idcol="id")
View(df3)


3. If the above 25 files were csv files, what would be your script to read?
Answer-
file.list <- list.files(pattern='*.csv')

# data frame by column with column id
df.list <- lapply(file.list, read.csv)
df_csv <- rbindlist(df.list, idcol = "id")
View(df_csv)

# data frame by column with coulmn id as file name
df.list<- sapply(file.list, read.csv, simplify = FALSE)
df_csv2 <- rbindlist(df.list, idcol = "id")
View(df_csv2)

# data frame by row with file names in column 
df_csv3 <- rbind.data.frame(df.list, idcol = "id")
View(df_csv3)
